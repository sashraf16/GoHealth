Hello.

First of all, thank you for giving me the chance to be considered for this role. I wanted to quickly share that I decided to go with something simple from the project side and testing side in order to get this submission back as soon as I could. I have only started learning testing on my own time (due to being told that as a candidate, I was sorely lacking testing), but I have grown comfortable as a full-stack web developer. I would love to talk more about what I've worked on and why I believe I'm a good fit.

Thanks,
Bilal
